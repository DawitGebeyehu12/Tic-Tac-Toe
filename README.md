Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React.
The game allows two players to take turns marking the cells in a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O".
The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all the cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

Features

   - Real-time gameplay: The game alternates between two players, displaying the next playerâ€™s turn.
     
   - Winner detection: The game automatically detects and announces the winner.
     
   - Tie detection: If no player wins, it declares a tie.
     
   - Reset functionality: Players can reset the game and start over.
     
   - Responsive design: The game layout is responsive and user-friendly.
